// More Function Exercises!

// 1. Without using Math.min(), write a function called minimum() that takes two numbers
//    and outputs the smallest one to the console.

// 2. Create a new function called minimum3() to find the smallest of three numbers

// 3. Declare a function called sum() that takes an array of numbers as an argument adds them.
//    i.e. sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 10.

// 4. Declare a function called multiply() that takes an array of numbers and multiplies them together.
//    i.e. multiply([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 24.

// 5. Write a function called filterSixPlus() that takes the following array and returns words
//    that are six characters or longer.
      var words = ["window", "table", "barstool", "glass", "charger", "outlet"];

// 6. Use a function to ask a user for a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit.

// 7. Adding to the code in #2, prompt the user a second time to determine whether they'd like to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius
//    or from Celsius to Fahrenheit. To keep it simple, instruct them to use "F to C" or "C to F".
//    Alert them with an error if they do not follow the rules.

// 8. Write a function countBs() that takes a string as its only argument and returns
//    a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.
//    HINT: Google charAt()


// 9. Write a function called countChars() that behaves like countBs(), except it takes a
//    second argument that indicates what character is to be counted.

// 10. Declare a function called ohZero() that replaces all of the o's in a string with 0's.
      var string = "Soon you will master functions!";
