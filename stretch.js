// Stretch Goals

// 1. Write function that translates a sentence into pig latin.
//     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin
//     i.e. "look at my cool function" --> "ooklay atyay ymay oolcay unctionfay"

// 2. Write a function that prints out the entire "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" song lyrics.

// 3. Create a 'Guessing Game'. The game starts by picking a random number.
//    It then prompts the user to guess the number. If the user's number is lower/higher,
//    it will prompt the user to enter another guess and tell the user if the guess was
//    too high or too low. This continues until the correct guess is entered.
//    When the correct guess is entered the user is given a success message with the correct number.
